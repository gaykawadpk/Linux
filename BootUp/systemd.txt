systemd
======================================================
- systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. 

- It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts 
the rest of the system. 

- systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities.

- It uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand 
starting of daemons.

- It keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains 
mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional 
dependency-based service control logic. 

- systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement 
for sysvinit. 

- Other parts of systemd include a logging daemon, utilities to control basic 
system configuration like the hostname, date, locale, maintain a list of logged-in 
users and running containers and virtual machines, system accounts, runtime 
directories and settings, and daemons to manage simple network configuration, 
network time synchronization, log forwarding, and name resolution.


systemd Targets
============================================
A systemd target represents a Linux system's current or desired run state. 
Much like SystemV start scripts, targets define the services that must be 
present for the system to run and be active in that state. 

Each target has a set of dependencies described in its configuration file. 
systemd starts the required dependencies, which are the services required 
to run the Linux host at a specific level of functionality. When all of the 
dependencies listed in the target configuration files are loaded and running, 
the system is running at that target level. 

To see all of the targets available on system run:
systemctl --type=target

Comparison of SystemV runlevels with systemd targets and target aliases: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
systemd targets		SystemV		target aliases		Description
					runlevel
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
default.target	 	 								This target is always aliased 
													with a symbolic link to either 
													multi-user.target or graphical.target. 
													systemd always uses the default.target 
													to start the system. 
													The default.target should never 
													be aliased to halt.target, 
													poweroff.target, or reboot.target.
													
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
graphical.target		5		runlevel5.target	Multi-user.target with a GUI

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						4		runlevel4.target	Unused. Runlevel 4 was identical to 
													runlevel 3 in the SystemV world. 
													This target could be created and 
													customized to start local services 
													without changing the default 
													multi-user.target.
													
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
multi-user.target		3	runlevel3.target		All services running, but command-line 
													interface (CLI) only.
													
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						2	runlevel2.target		Multi-user, without NFS, but all other 
													non-GUI services running.
													
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rescue.target			1	runlevel1.target		A basic system, including mounting the 
													filesystems with only the most basic 
													services running and a rescue shell 
													on the main console.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
emergency.target		S	 						Single-user modeâ€”no services are 
													running; filesystems are not mounted. 
													This is the most basic level of 
													operation with only an emergency 
													shell running on the main console 
													for the user to interact with the system.
													
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
halt.target	 	 									Halts the system without powering
													it down.
													
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reboot.target			6		runlevel6.target	Reboot

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
poweroff.target			0		runlevel0.target	Halts the system and turns 
													the power off



systemd units:
===============================
Units commonly include, but are not limited to, services (.service), 
mount points (.mount), devices (.device) and sockets (.socket).


System start up using systemd:
--------------------------------------
Unless otherwise changed at boot time in the GRUB menu, systemd always starts the 
default.target. The default.target file is a symbolic link to the true target file. 
For a desktop workstation, this is typically going to be the graphical.target, which 
is equivalent to runlevel 5 in SystemV. For a server, the default is more likely 
to be the multi-user.target, which is like runlevel 3 in SystemV. The emergency.target 
file is similar to single-user mode. Targets and services are systemd units.

In systemd based Linux startup system, once the kernel gives control to startup system,
i.e. /sbin/init. systemd first starts itself as PID1. systemd is the mother of all 
processes and it is responsible for bringing the Linux host up to a state in which 
productive work can be done.
