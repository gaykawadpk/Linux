Boot time optimization:
-----------------------------------------
1. Analyzing boot up time:
We can use the systemd-analyze command to understand the systemâ€™s boot time 
overview and pinpoint specific services causing delays.

systemd-analyze gives the startup time of kernel and each services running on system.

systemd-analyze plot > bootchart.svg give plot of system startup.

2. Optimizing kernel boot time:
We can optimizing kernel boot up, by disabling unnecessary kernel modules.

3. Disable unnecessary services:
We can list down the services which we are not using from boot chart and remove/disable
them from our rfs.

4. Optimizing individual services startup:
We can look into bootchart to list down which services are taking longer to boot and 
then analyze those services individually to see why their startup is taking time and 
if we can optimiz their code.

5. Using default linux provided configuration for mounting devices and configuring network,
rather than using bash script for that.

6. Correcting dependencies of the services. Sometimes, wrong dependecies can create some 
issues while starting individual services. So, make sure we are setting up dependencies 
correctly.

7. Rearranging startup sequence to bring necessary services before. We can find out the
services which we can start at later stage and move them towards end of boot up process.
